What are the main eye-related symptoms and genetic cause of Wagner syndrome?,"Wagner syndrome: Wagner syndrome Description Wagner syndrome is a hereditary disorder that causes progressive vision loss. The eye problems that lead to vision loss typically begin in childhood, although the vision impairment might not be immediately apparent. In people with Wagner syndrome, the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye ( the retina ) becomes thin and may separate from the back of the eye ( retinal detachment ). The blood vessels within the retina (known as the choroid) may also be abnormal. The retina and the choroid progressively break down (degenerate). Some people with Wagner syndrome have blurred vision because of ectopic fovea, an abnormality in which the part of the retina responsible for sharp central vision is out of place. Additionally, the thick, clear gel that fills the eyeball (the vitreous) becomes watery and thin. People with Wagner syndrome develop a clouding of the lens of the eye ( cataract ). Affected individuals may also experience nearsightedness ( myopia ), progressive night blindness, or a narrowing of their field of vision. Vision impairment in people with Wagner syndrome can vary from near normal vision to complete loss of vision in both eyes. Frequency Wagner syndrome is a rare disorder, although its exact prevalence is unknown. Approximately 300 affected individuals have been described worldwide; about half of these individuals are from the Netherlands. Causes Mutations in the VCAN gene cause Wagner syndrome. The VCAN gene provides instructions for making a protein called versican. Versican is found in the extracellular matrix, which is the intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells. Versican interacts with many of these proteins and molecules to facilitate the assembly of the extracellular matrix and ensure its stability. Within the eye , versican interacts with other proteins to maintain the structure and gel-like consistency of the vitreous. VCAN gene mutations that cause Wagner syndrome lead to insufficient levels of versican in the vitreous. Without enough versican to interact with the many proteins of the vitreous, the structure becomes unstable. This lack of stability in the vitreous affects other areas of the eye and contributes to the vision problems that occur in people with Wagner syndrome. It is unknown why VCAN gene mutations seem solely to affect vision. Learn more about the gene associated with Wagner syndrome VCAN Inheritance This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern , which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.

They often have progressive vision loss, blurry vision caused by an abnormally placed fovea, and develop cataracts. Nearsightedness (myopia), worsening night blindness, and a shrinking field of vision are also common. These problems stem from mutations in the VCAN gene, which result in too little versican protein in the eye's vitreous. This lack of versican compromises the eye's structural stability, leading to the visual difficulties."
Describe hereditary angioedema and identify the body regions most commonly affected during an attack.,"Hereditary angioedema is a disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of severe swelling (angioedema). The parts of the body that are most often affected by swelling are the limbs, face, intestinal tract, and airway. Minor trauma or stress may trigger an attack, but swelling often occurs without a known trigger. Episodes involving the intestinal tract cause severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Swelling in the airway can restrict breathing and lead to life-threatening obstruction of the airway. About one-third of people with this condition develop a non-itchy rash called erythema marginatum during an attack. Symptoms of hereditary angioedema typically begin in childhood and worsen during puberty. On average, untreated individuals have swelling episodes every 1 to 2 weeks, and most episodes last for about 3 to 4 days. The frequency and duration of attacks vary greatly among people with hereditary angioedema, even among people in the same family. Hereditary angioedema is broadly divided into two types, which are distinguished by levels of a protein called C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) in the blood. These types are known as hereditary angioedema due to C1-INH deficiency and hereditary angioedema with normal C1-INH. Hereditary angioedema due to C1-INH deficiency is further divided into two types: type I occurs when C1-INH levels are low, and type II occurs when the C1-INH protein is not functioning correctly. The different types of hereditary angioedema have similar signs and symptoms. Frequency Hereditary angioedema is estimated to affect 1 in 50,000 people worldwide. Hereditary angioedema due to C1-INH deficiency accounts for the vast majority of cases. Causes Variants (also called mutations) in the SERPING1 gene cause hereditary angioedema due to C1-INH deficiency. The SERPING1 gene provides instructions for making the C1-INH protein, which is important for controlling the immune response and inflammation. The C1-INH protein blocks the activity of certain proteins that promote inflammation. SERPING1 gene variants that cause hereditary angioedema due to C1-INH deficiency type I lead to reduced levels of C1-INH in the blood, while variants that cause type II result in the production of a C1-INH protein that functions abnormally. When the body does not have enough normal C1-INH protein, it ends up with excessive amounts of a protein fragment (peptide) called bradykinin. Bradykinin promotes inflammation by increasing the amount of fluid that leaks through the walls of blood vessels into body tissues (vascular permeability). The accumulation of fluids in body tissues causes the episodes of swelling seen in individuals with hereditary angioedema due to C1-INH deficiency. Variants in the F12 gene cause most cases of hereditary angioedema with normal C1-INH. The F12 gene provides instructions for making a protein called coagulation factor XII. In addition to playing a critical role in blood clotting (coagulation), factor XII is also an important stimulator of inflammation and is involved in the production of bradykinin. In people with hereditary angioedema with normal C1-INH, variants in the F12 gene cause cells to produce a factor XII protein that is easier to activate than normal. As a result, a greater-than-normal amount of bradykinin is released. More bradykinin leads to increased inflammation and leaky blood vessel walls, which causes the episodes of swelling seen in people with hereditary angioedema with normal C1-INH. Variants in a few other genes are responsible for a small number of additional cases of hereditary angioedema with normal C1-INH. The cause of other cases of hereditary angioedema with normal C1-INH remain unknown.Inheritance This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In some cases, an affected person inherits the variant from one affected parent. Other cases result from a new (de novo) variant in a gene that occur during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) in an affected individual's parent or in early embryonic development. These affected individuals have no history of the disorder in their family.

What are the typical age of onset and main neurological features of Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy?,"Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy is a brain disorder characterized by recurrent seizures (epilepsy) and a decline in intellectual function. The signs and symptoms of the disorder usually appear in late childhood or adolescence and worsen with time. Myoclonus is a term used to describe episodes of sudden, involuntary muscle jerking or twitching that can affect part of the body or the entire body. Myoclonus can occur when an affected person is at rest, and it is made worse by motion, excitement, or flashing light (photic stimulation). In the later stages of Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy, myoclonus often occurs continuously and affects the entire body. Several types of seizures commonly occur in people with Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (also known as grand mal seizures) affect the entire body, causing muscle rigidity, convulsions, and loss of consciousness. Affected individuals may also experience occipital seizures, which can cause temporary blindness and visual hallucinations. Over time, the seizures worsen and become more difficult to treat. A life-threatening seizure condition called status epilepticus may also develop. Status epilepticus is a continuous state of seizure activity lasting longer than several minutes. About the same time seizures begin, intellectual function starts to decline. Behavioral changes, depression, confusion, and speech difficulties (dysarthria) are among the early signs and symptoms of this disorder. As the condition worsens, a continued loss of intellectual function (dementia) impairs memory, judgment, and thought. Affected people lose the ability to perform the activities of daily living by their mid-twenties, and they ultimately require comprehensive care. People with Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy generally survive up to 10 years after symptoms first appear. Frequency The prevalence of Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy is unknown. Although the condition occurs worldwide, it appears to be most common in Mediterranean countries (including Spain, France, and Italy), parts of Central Asia, India, Pakistan, North Africa, and the Middle East. Causes Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy can be caused by mutations in either the EPM2A gene or the NHLRC1 gene. These genes provide instructions for making proteins called laforin and malin, respectively. Laforin and malin play a critical role in the survival of nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. Studies suggest that laforin and malin work together and may have several functions. One of these is to help regulate the production of a complex sugar called glycogen, which is a major source of stored energy in the body. The body stores this sugar in the liver and muscles, breaking it down when it is needed for fuel. Laforin and malin may prevent a potentially damaging buildup of glycogen in tissues that do not normally store this molecule, such as those of the nervous system. Researchers have discovered that people with Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy have distinctive clumps called Lafora bodies within their cells. Lafora bodies are made up of an abnormal form of glycogen that cannot be broken down and used for fuel. Instead, it builds up to form clumps that can damage cells. Neurons appear to be particularly vulnerable to this type of damage. Although Lafora bodies are found in many of the body's tissues, the signs and symptoms of Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy are limited to the nervous system. Mutations in the EPM2A gene prevent cells from making functional laforin, while NHLRC1 gene mutations prevent the production of functional malin. It is unclear how a loss of either of these proteins leads to the formation of Lafora bodies. However, a loss of laforin or malin ultimately results in the death of neurons, which interferes with the brain's normal functions. The condition tends to progress more slowly in some people with NHLRC1 gene mutations than in those with EPM2A gene mutations. Mutations in the EPM2A and NHLRC1 genes account for 80 percent to 90 percent of all cases of Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy. In the remaining cases, the cause of the condition is unknown. Researchers are searching for other genetic changes that may underlie this disease. Inheritance This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

Its hallmark features are myoclonic jerks—sudden, shock-like muscle spasms often triggered by action or noise—and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. As the disorder progresses, patients suffer a gradual decline in cognitive function and develop ataxia (difficulty walking). The disease stems from mutations in either the EPM2A or NHLRC1 genes, leading to neuronal deposits known as Lafora bodies."
"Outline the key clinical features of Cohen syndrome, including facial and developmental characteristics. ","Cohen syndrome is an inherited disorder that affects many parts of the body and is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, small head size (microcephaly), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Other features common in this condition include worsening nearsightedness (myopia), breakdown (degeneration) of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retinal dystrophy), an unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility), and distinctive facial features. These facial features typically include thick hair and eyebrows, long eyelashes, unusually-shaped eyes (down-slanting and wave-shaped), a bulbous nasal tip, a smooth or shortened area between the nose and the upper lip (philtrum), and prominent upper central teeth. The combination of the last two facial features results in an open mouth. The features of Cohen syndrome vary widely among affected individuals. Additional signs and symptoms in some individuals with this disorder include low levels of white blood cells (neutropenia), overly friendly behavior, and obesity that develops in late childhood or adolescence. When obesity is present, it typically occurs around the torso, with the arms and legs remaining slender (called truncal obesity). Individuals with Cohen syndrome may also have narrow hands and feet, and slender fingers. Frequency The exact incidence of Cohen syndrome is unknown. It has been diagnosed in fewer than 1,000 people worldwide. More cases are likely undiagnosed. Causes Mutations in the VPS13B gene (also called the COH1 gene) cause Cohen syndrome. The protein produced from this gene is a part of the Golgi apparatus, which is a cell structure in which newly produced proteins are modified so they can carry out their functions. In particular, the VPS13B protein is involved in a modification called glycosylation, which is the attachment of sugar molecules to proteins. The VPS13B protein also appears to be involved in the sorting and transporting of proteins inside the cell. This protein is thought to be involved in normal growth and development of nerve cells (neurons) and fat cells (adipocytes), and may play a role in the storage and distribution of fats in the body. Most mutations in the VPS13B gene are believed to prevent the production of functional VPS13B protein. Studies suggest that a loss of this protein disrupts the organization of the Golgi apparatus and impairs normal glycosylation. However, it is not known how a lack of functional VPS13B protein or these cellular changes lead to the signs and symptoms of Cohen syndrome. Researchers speculate that problems with neuron development underlie microcephaly, intellectual disability, and retinal dystrophy and that abnormal fat storage may cause truncal obesity in people with Cohen syndrome.

What metabolic block occurs in isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency and what are potential clinical consequences?,"Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IBD) deficiency is a condition that disrupts the breakdown of certain proteins. Normally, proteins from food are broken down into amino acids. Amino acids can be further processed to provide energy for growth and development. People with IBD deficiency have problems breaking down the amino acid valine. Most people with IBD deficiency are asymptomatic, which means that they do not have any signs or symptoms of the condition. If signs or symptoms do appear, they typically show early in life and only last for a short period of time. These signs and symptoms can include weak muscle tone (hypotonia), developmental delays, slow growth, a low number of red blood cells (anemia), and seizures. Because IBD deficiency is rare and often does not cause signs and symptoms, it is difficult to know if the health problems seen in affected individuals are caused by this condition or if those health problems are unrelated to the condition. It is also unclear whether IBD deficiency causes health problems later in life. Newborn screening, which identifies abnormal levels of certain compounds in the blood, can detect IBD deficiency. People with IBD deficiency have high levels of a compound called carnitine (specifically a form called C4-acylcarnitine). Cells use carnitine, a natural substance that is acquired mostly through the diet, to process fats and produce energy. Frequency IBD deficiency is a rare disorder. Worldwide, the prevalence of this disorder is estimated to vary from 1 in 52,000 to 292,000 people. Causes Variants (also called mutations) in the ACAD8 gene cause IBD deficiency. This gene provides instructions for making the IBD enzyme. This enzyme is found in mitochondria, which are the energy producing centers inside cells. Within mitochondria, the IBD enzyme is involved in breaking down valine. Specifically, this enzyme functions in the third step of this process, which converts the molecule isobutyryl-CoA to the molecule methacrylyl-CoA. This is a critical step in the process of converting the energy from food into a form that cells can use. ACAD8 gene variants reduce or eliminate the activity of the IBD enzyme. As a result, valine cannot be broken down properly. This may lead to reduced energy production and cause the features of IBD deficiency in some people. Inheritance This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell must have a variant to cause the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the altered gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

This enzyme defect causes buildup of isobutyryl-CoA and its byproducts, detectable via newborn metabolic screening. While some individuals remain asymptomatic, others may develop metabolic ketoacidosis, muscle hypotonia, and developmental delays. The disorder follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern."
Define essential pentosuria and explain why it is generally clinically benign.,"Essential pentosuria is a condition characterized by high levels of a sugar called L-xylulose in urine. The condition is so named because L-xylulose is a type of sugar called a pentose. Despite the excess sugar, affected individuals have no associated health problems. Frequency Essential pentosuria occurs almost exclusively in individuals with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Approximately 1 in 3,300 people in this population are affected. Causes Essential pentosuria is caused by mutations in the DCXR gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called dicarbonyl and L-xylulose reductase (DCXR), which plays multiple roles in the body. One of its functions is to perform a chemical reaction that converts a sugar called L-xylulose to a molecule called xylitol. This reaction is one step in a process by which the body can use sugars for energy. DCXR gene mutations lead to the production of altered DCXR proteins that are quickly broken down. Without this protein, L-xylulose is not converted to xylitol, and the excess sugar is released in the urine. While essential pentosuria is caused by genetic mutations, some people develop a non-inherited form of pentosuria if they eat excessive amounts of fruits high in L-xylulose or another pentose called L-arabinose. This form of the condition, which disappears if the diet is changed, is referred to as alimentary pentosuria. Studies show that some drugs can also cause a form of temporary pentosuria called drug-induced pentosuria. These non-inherited forms of the condition also do not cause any health problems. Learn more about the gene associated with Essential pentosuria Inheritance This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.

"What is myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy, and how does it affect strength and appearance?","Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy: Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy Description Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy is a rare condition characterized by reduced body fat and increased muscle size. Affected individuals have up to twice the usual amount of muscle mass in their bodies. They also tend to have increased muscle strength. Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy is not known to cause any medical problems, and affected individuals are intellectually normal. Frequency The prevalence of this condition is unknown. Causes Variants (also known as mutations) in the MSTN gene cause myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy. The MSTN gene provides instructions for making a protein called myostatin, which is active in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles) both before and after birth. This protein normally limits muscle growth, ensuring that muscles do not grow too large. Variants that reduce the production of functional myostatin lead to an overgrowth of muscle tissue. Learn more about the gene associated with Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy MSTN Inheritance Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy has a pattern of inheritance known as incomplete autosomal dominance. People with a variant in both copies of the MSTN gene in each cell (homozygotes) have significantly increased muscle mass and strength. People with a variant in one copy of the MSTN gene in each cell (heterozygotes) also have increased muscle bulk, but to a lesser degree.

Describe keratoconus and its characteristic corneal changes.,"Keratoconus is an eye condition that affects the shape of the cornea, which is the clear outer covering of the eye. In this condition, the cornea thins and bulges outward, eventually resembling a cone shape. These corneal abnormalities, which worsen over time, can lead to nearsightedness (myopia), blurred vision that cannot be improved with corrective lenses (irregular astigmatism), and vision loss. Other corneal changes typical of keratoconus that can be seen during an eye exam include iron deposits in the cornea that form a yellow-to-brownish ring, called the Fleischer ring, surrounding the colored part of the eye (iris). Affected individuals may also develop Vogt's striae, which are thin, vertical, white lines in the tissue at the back of the cornea. Keratoconus may affect only one eye at first, but eventually the corneas of both eyes become misshapen, although they might not be affected with the same severity. As keratoconus worsens, people with this condition can develop corneal scarring, often caused by exposure of the abnormally thin cornea to prolonged contact lens use or excessive eye rubbing. The eye changes characteristic of keratoconus typically begin in adolescence and slowly worsen until mid-adulthood at which point the shape of the cornea remains stable. Frequency Collapse Section Keratoconus is estimated to affect 1 in 500 to 2,000 individuals worldwide. Causes Collapse Section The cause of keratoconus is unknown. Researchers have studied many different factors, both genetic and environmental, that are thought to influence the risk of developing keratoconus. The environmental factors that may contribute to keratoconus include excessive eye rubbing and the tendency to develop allergic disorders (atopy). Excessive and vigorous eye rubbing can cause trauma to the cornea and may lead to its thinning. However, it is unclear whether eye rubbing leads to keratoconus or if eye rubbing is a response to eye discomfort in the early stages of the condition. If eye rubbing is not involved in the development of keratoconus, it likely contributes to worsening of the condition. Approximately one-third of individuals with keratoconus have an allergic disorder, although it is unclear how allergic disorders are related to the development of keratoconus. Allergies might trigger eye rubbing, which can aggravate eye problems. Changes in multiple genes have been associated with developing keratoconus. Many of these variants have been found only in small populations or single families. In most individuals with keratoconus, a combination of genetic and environmental factors is needed for the condition to develop. However, some affected individuals seem to have a largely environmental cause for the condition while others seem to have a largely genetic cause. Individuals with a relative who has keratoconus have an increased risk of developing the condition compared to people without a family history. More than a dozen genes have been associated with keratoconus. These genes have varied functions. The most frequently associated genes play roles in eye development, the formation and structure of the cornea, the intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the space between cells (extracellular matrix), an immune system response called inflammation, and the regulation of cell growth. It is thought that a disruption in one of these processes, in combination with an environmental trigger, may lead to the development of keratoconus. Keratoconus can be a feature of genetic syndromes, such as Leber congenital amaurosis and arterial tortuosity syndrome. When it is part of a syndrome, keratoconus is caused by the same genetic mutation that causes the syndrome. Mutations in the genes that cause syndromes with keratoconus have not been found to cause keratoconus without other features.

The condition can also occur in families. In some cases, keratoconus is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. An affected person often has one parent with the condition, although some people who have a gene variant never develop the condition, a situation known as reduced penetrance. Keratoconus can also be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means variants occur in both copies of the gene in each cell. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the altered gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. Other Names for This Condition Collapse Section Bulging cornea Conical cornea KC","Keratoconus is a progressive thinning of the cornea, causing it to bulge into a cone-like shape.

"What are the hallmark craniofacial features of Bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome (BAMS), and how is the condition typically diagnosed, including the imaging or genetic tests used to confirm it?","Bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome (BAMS) is a rare condition characterized by abnormalities of the nose and eyes and problems with puberty. The key feature of BAMS is arhinia, which is the absence of an external nose. While most people with BAMS are born without a nose, some affected individuals have a severely underdeveloped (hypoplastic) nose. Affected individuals may also be missing the brain structure involved in the sense of smell (olfactory bulb). Because of these abnormalities, people with BAMS have an impaired ability to smell and, consequently, to taste. In most people with BAMS, the eyeballs are abnormally small (microphthalmia) or absent (anophthalmia), which causes severe vision impairment or blindness. Additional eye abnormalities common in BAMS include a gap or hole in one of several structures of the eye (coloboma) and clouding of the lenses of the eyes (cataracts). Additional head and face abnormalities that can occur in people with BAMS include a high arch or opening in the roof of the mouth (high-arched or cleft palate), absence of the sinuses behind the nose (paranasal sinuses), blockage of the nasal passages (choanal atresia), narrowing of the tear ducts (nasolacrimal duct stenosis), or a small upper jaw (hypoplastic maxilla). Many of these abnormalities contribute to difficulty breathing, particularly in affected babies. Some affected individuals have abnormal external ears. Individuals with BAMS also have hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which is a condition caused by reduced production of hormones that direct sexual development. Without treatment, these hormone problems often result in delayed puberty. Affected males may also have underdeveloped reproductive tissues and undescended testes (cryptorchidism). Frequency BAMS is a very rare condition with an unknown prevalence. Fewer than 100 cases of the condition have been described in the medical literature. BAMS has been found in several different populations. Causes BAMS is usually caused by mutations in the SMCHD1 gene. Other, unknown genes may be rare causes of the condition. The SMCHD1 gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in regulating gene activity by altering the structure of DNA. Specifically, the SMCHD1 protein plays a role in turning off (silencing) certain genes. Among other functions, the SMCHD1 protein appears to be important for development of the nose, eyes, and other structures of the head and face. Researchers are unsure how SMCHD1 gene mutations affect the protein's function and lead to the development problems characteristic of BAMS. Changes in this gene may lead to abnormal silencing of genes involved in development of the head and face, which could underlie arhinia, microphthalmia, and other characteristic facial abnormalities of BAMS. Problems with nasal development may affect gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, which are nerve cells that control the release of reproductive hormones. GnRH neurons originate in the developing nose and then move to the brain. Impaired development of these neurons could explain hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in affected individuals. Some people with an SMCHD1 gene mutation have arhinia without other features of BAMS (isolated arhinia) or less severe abnormalities of the nose, leading researchers to suspect that additional genetic factors contribute to the severity of the symptoms. These additional factors are not yet known. Learn more about the gene associated with Bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome Inheritance This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered SMCHD1 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. The parent often has milder symptoms, such as a reduced sense of smell (anosmia), arhinia without other features of BAMS, or less severe abnormalities of the nose.

These include the absence of an external nose (arhinia), abnormally small eyeballs (microphthalmia) or the complete absence of eyeballs (anophthalmia). Other associated abnormalities can include coloboma, cataracts, a high-arched or cleft palate, absence of paranasal sinuses, choanal atresia, nasolacrimal duct stenosis, and an underdeveloped maxilla. Unfortunately, I don't have information about the typical diagnostic methods for BAMS, such as specific imaging techniques or genetic tests used to confirm the diagnosis."
What is Alzheimer disease and which part of the brain does it primarily affect? Are there any curative treatments?,"Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative disease of the brain that causes dementia, which is a gradual loss of memory, judgment, and ability to function. This disorder usually appears in people older than age 65, but less common forms of the disease appear earlier in adulthood. Memory loss is the most common sign of Alzheimer's disease. Forgetfulness may be subtle at first, but the loss of memory worsens over time until it interferes with most aspects of daily living. Even in familiar settings, a person with Alzheimer's disease may get lost or become confused. Routine tasks such as preparing meals, doing laundry, and performing other household chores can be challenging. Additionally, it may become difficult to recognize people and name objects. Affected people increasingly require help with dressing, eating, and personal care. As the disorder progresses, some people with Alzheimer's disease experience personality and behavioral changes and have trouble interacting in a socially appropriate manner. Other common symptoms include agitation, restlessness, withdrawal, and loss of language skills. People with Alzheimer's disease usually require total care during the advanced stages of the disease. Individuals with Alzheimer's disease usually survive 8 to 10 years after the appearance of symptoms, but the course of the disease can range from 1 to 25 years. Survival is usually shorter in individuals diagnosed after age 80 than in those diagnosed at a younger age. In Alzheimer's disease, death usually results from pneumonia, malnutrition, or general body wasting (inanition). Alzheimer's disease can be classified as early-onset or late-onset. The signs and symptoms of the early-onset form appear between a person's thirties and mid-sixties, while the late-onset form appears during or after a person's mid-sixties. The early-onset form of Alzheimer's disease is much less common than the late-onset form, accounting for less than 10 percent of all cases of Alzheimer's disease. Frequency Alzheimer's disease currently affects more than 5 million Americans. Because the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease increases with age and more people are living longer, the number of people with this disease is expected to increase significantly in coming decades. Causes Some cases of early-onset Alzheimer's disease are caused by gene variants (also called mutations) that can be passed from parent to child. This results in what is known as early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Researchers have found that this form of the disorder can result from variants in the APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2 genes. When any of these genes is altered, large amounts of a toxic protein fragment called amyloid beta peptide are produced in the brain. This peptide can build up in the brain to form clumps called amyloid plaques, which are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. A buildup of toxic amyloid beta peptide and amyloid plaques may lead to the death of nerve cells and the progressive signs and symptoms of this disorder. Other cases of early-onset Alzheimer's disease may be associated with changes in different genes, some of which have not been identified. Some evidence indicates that people with Down syndrome have an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Down syndrome, a condition characterized by intellectual disability and other health problems, occurs when a person is born with an extra copy of chromosome 21 in each cell. As a result, people with Down syndrome have three copies of many genes in each cell, including the APP gene, instead of the usual two copies. Although the connection between Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease is unclear, the production of excess amyloid beta peptide in cells may account for the increased risk. People with Down syndrome account for less than 1 percent of all cases of Alzheimer's disease. This type of Alzheimer's disease is not inherited. The causes of late-onset Alzheimer's disease are less clear. The late-onset form does not clearly run in families, although clusters of cases have been reported in some families. Alzheimer's disease is probably related to variations in one or more genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors. A gene called APOE has been studied extensively as a risk factor for the disease. In particular, a variant of this gene called the e4 allele seems to increase an individual's risk for developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Many more genes have been associated with Alzheimer's disease, and researchers are investigating the role that additional genes may play in Alzheimer's disease risk. Learn more about the genes associated with Alzheimer's disease Inheritance Early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person inherits the altered gene from one affected parent. The inheritance pattern of late-onset Alzheimer's disease is uncertain. People who inherit one copy of the APOE e4 allele have an increased chance of developing the disease; those who inherit two copies of the allele are at even greater risk. It is important to note that people with the APOE e4 allele inherit an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, not the disease itself. Not all people with Alzheimer's disease have the e4 allele, and not all people who have the e4 allele will develop the disease.
